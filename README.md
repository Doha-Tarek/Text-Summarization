# Text Summarization
This application was designed to help users quickly summarize text files and gain some intuition without having to read the whole file. It uses tkinter, 
a Python GUI library, to build an intuitive desktop application that allows users to select a text file from their computer and have it summarized based
on the frequency of words in the document. The summary generated by this app provides a concise overview of what is contained within each document so that 
users can get an idea of its contents before they decide if they want or need more information.

## Requirements
- NLTK --> pip install nltk

## Idea
The basic idea of text summarization is to count the frequency of words occurring in the text and assume that those words which occur most frequently are important.
This process allows for a quick overview of a large amount of information, as it focuses on only the key points and eliminates any unnecessary details.
